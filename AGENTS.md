## Aghbari Commerce
- Legacy Bolt UI lives in src/components (AghbariApp, Storefront, AdminPages, OperationsCenter) and src/lib (api, types); extend it, do not rewrite — the spec mandates incremental build.
- src/lib/supabase.ts re-exports the Cloud client loosely typed so api.ts keeps its hand-written contracts in types.ts.
- Admin access = user_roles role in admin/manager/staff checked by public.is_staff(); customers order only via the place_order RPC so prices are computed server-side.
- Profiles are created by the ensure_profile RPC after sign-in (no triggers on auth schema); first signed-up user becomes admin.


## Permanent session-resume protocol (mandatory for repository-aware agents)

This project must resume from repository evidence; the owner must not be asked to resend information already saved here.

1. At session start, run `git fetch origin`, `git status --short --branch`, `git branch --show-current`, `git rev-parse HEAD`, `git rev-parse origin/main`, and `git log -1 --oneline`. Inspect GitHub Actions for the exact current `main` SHA. Protect any dirty/uncommitted work; never reset or overwrite it to make the tree look clean.
2. Read `PROJECT_MEMORY.md`, `ops/AGHBARI-SESSION-RESUME.md`, `ops/AGHBARI-LATEST-EXECUTION-STATE.md`, `docs/canonical/AGHBARI-REQUIREMENT-REGISTRY.md`, `docs/canonical/AGHBARI-EXECUTION-MANDATE.md`, and consult `docs/canonical/AGHBARI-MASTER-PROJECT-SPECIFICATION.md` only for the specific acceptance criteria needed. Treat remote `main` and exact-SHA evidence as truth; saved SHAs are checkpoints, not assumed HEAD.
3. Take `next_task_id` from the latest execution-state checkpoint and match it to the single requirement registry. Do not repeat repository-wide discovery, restate the same specification, or reopen `DONE_VERIFIED` work unless its SHA/dependency/input changed, a regression or security issue appeared, or its evidence became invalid. When the first open item is externally blocked, record the concrete blocker and continue the next safe, executable task without inventing success.
4. Implement the smallest coherent end-to-end change, run relevant real tests, fix failures, and record task ID, changed paths, commands, results, exact tested SHA, next task ID, and evidence-backed blockers. Update the existing canonical memory/resume/state/registry records in the same related batch; never create duplicate progress ledgers.
5. Commit and push safely to `origin/main` only after validation; never force-push published history. Then verify remote HEAD and Actions for that exact SHA. A push, green parent-SHA CI, Git integration, or repository text is not proof that the new SHA passed or that Lovable actually synchronized.
6. `AGENTS.md` is the shared agent-instruction source; `.github/copilot-instructions.md` provides GitHub Copilot's repository-wide entry point. Do not claim that another host (including Lovable) automatically loaded these files unless that host/session provides direct evidence. Repository instructions are persisted, but host-specific loading/sync remains a separately verified fact.

Execution order: `INSPECT CURRENT STATE → RESUME NEXT OPEN TASK → IMPLEMENT → TEST → FIX → VERIFY → COMMIT → PUSH MAIN → SYNC LOVABLE`.
